<p>
... but it shouldn't stay that way, so I started this github account and I'm already learning Jekyll!
</p>

<p>
The repository will contain code that I deemed "keep-worthy" and shouldn't be trusted to live on my hard-drive alone. The first example of this is <a href="https://github.com/maltemuth/show-when-checked">show-when-checked</a>, a jQuery-dependent snippet that I've rewritten 4 times before realising that I should just stow it away for later reuse.
</p>

<p>
But there must be a better way to do this, so feedback is very welcome.
